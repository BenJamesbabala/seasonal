Excerpts from the NAB Corpus
=================================================

Numenta's Anomaly Benchmark includes a variety of annotated
timeseries, mostly short-term operations metrics (ie, no lasting
trends). The project lives here: https://github.com/numenta/NAB

Each of these has been reformatted to consist of an index column and a
value column. The index may be an ISO datetime, or simply an integer
if time information has been lost.
